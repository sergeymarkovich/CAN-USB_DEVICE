# CAN-USB_DEVICE
    Control Area Network (CAN) is an industrial standard, a network interface that allows the integration of various nodes, mechanisms, sensors, etc. into a single network. It was developed in 1987. firms BOSCH and INTEL to create onboard real-time multiprocessor systems. The protocol is broadcast, which means that all devices on the CAN network receive all signals transmitted over the bus. The standard does not regulate the physical layer of data transmission, so completely different options can be used, for example, fiber. The most commonly used connection is a two-wire differential line (twisted pair).
    For this device, an algorithm was developed based on the use of callback functions and interrupts. Initially, the code was implemented on the basis of filling the buffer array through the sprintf function, but this idea was not successful, because during intensive exchange, the exchange ceased to occur - this was due to the inappropriate operation of sprintf. It was decided to translate 4 bits of the frame into ASCII, for receiving from CAN to USB, but later it was replaced with simplified HAL call-back functions.
